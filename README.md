# Flashcard Program
by me</p>

## What is this?
This is a program written entirely in Java that allows the user to create flashcards and organize them using folders called sleeves. 
The user can move, edit, and delete the sleeves and flashcards they have created and choose which flashcards to use in a study session. </p>

## Why did I make this?
In my junior year of high school, I asked myself, "How can I show off my [still developing] Java programming skills?"
